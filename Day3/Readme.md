## Digging into Windows Internals
### View Exported Function
- For viewing exported functions in a DLL, you can use Dependency Walker http://www.dependencywalker.com
- Just open the tool and click on open file and choose kernel32.dll from C:\windows\System32

### Kernel Debugging
- Kernel Debugging means examining the internal kernel data structure or stepping through functions in the kernel
- There are particular set of files that we need in order to do kernel debugging, called as symbol files.
- Symbol files contain the names of functions and variables and the layout and format of data structures. They are generated by the linker and used by debuggers to reference and display these names during a debug session.
- To use any of the kernel-debugging tools to examine internal Windows kernel data structures such as the process list, thread blocks, loaded driver list, memory usage information, and so on, we must have the correct symbol files for at least the kernel image, Ntoskrnl.exe
