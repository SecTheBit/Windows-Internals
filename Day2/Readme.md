### Virtual Memory
- This concept of virtual memory is helpful when a page (small chunk of memory, having default size of 4kb) wants to be loaded into the memory(secondary) but memory is not available, then in that particular scenario virtual memory comes into picture and allows some memory from RAM itself.
- Virtual Memory is a storage scheme that provides user an illusion of having a very big main memory. This is done by treating a part of secondary memory as the main memory.

Note: A page, memory page, or virtual page is a fixed-length contiguous block of virtual memory, described by a single entry in the page table. It is the smallest unit of data for memory management in a virtual memory operating system.

  ### Kernel Mode vs User Mode

  #### Introduction
  - User application code runs in user mode, whereas OS code (such as system services and device drivers) runs in kernel mode.
  - Kernel mode refers to a mode of execution in a processor that grants access to all system memory and all CPU instructions.
  - These privilege levels or modes is called as rings.
  - When you open a process in user mode , the os createas a private virtual space because os wants to isolate the application's process from other process, so if a process crashes , it doesn't affect the other process.
    Whereas the kernel mode isn't isolated from the other drivers and the OS itself, so if a kernel driver crashes whole OS will crash

#### Ring

- Kernel mode operates in ring 0 level, where it have access to all memory regions and CPU
- Every applications running in normal user context will work in ring 3 level.
- The OS uses ring 1 to interact with the computerâ€™s hardware. This ring would need to run commands such as streaming a video through a camera on our monitor. Instructions that must interact with the system storage, loading, or saving files are stored in ring 2.

#### Memory Regions
- Pages in kernel/system mode space can be accessible from system itself not from user mode.
- Pages in user mode space can be accessible from both user and kernel mode
- Page which are not writable (only redable) cannot be writable from any mode
- Additionally, on processors that support no-execute memory protection, Windows marks pages containing data as non-executable, thus preventing inadvertent or malicious code execution in data areas (if this feature, Data Execution Prevention [DEP] is enabled
